		Hi, I'm {{ site.author }}!
		<br/><br/>

 		I am a senior software development engineer at Amazon, specializing in building cloud-native, distributed systems that drive innovation and solve complex challenges at scale. At AWS, I led the development of the EMR Managed Scaling service, a flagship solution empowering businesses to auto-scale big data workloads with efficiency, achieving significant cost savings and operational improvements. My work includes designing predictive algorithms that reduced costs by up to 50% and delivering solutions adopted by Fortune 500 clients.
		<br/><br/>
Previously, as a principal engineer at FICO, I spearheaded the modernization of legacy architectures, transitioning enterprise platforms to AWS and Kubernetes. Leading a 40-member team, I delivered scalable, high-performance applications while earning multiple patents, including innovations in database and search systems. My initiatives not only improved system resilience but also accelerated time-to-market and optimized operational efficiency.
		<br/><br/>
Beyond engineering, I am a mentor, thought leader, and advocate for continuous learning. Iâ€™ve authored influential technical blogs that have shaped industry best practices and guided teams to deliver impactful solutions aligned with strategic business objectives. Whether optimizing systems for performance or fostering innovation, I am dedicated to creating future-proof architectures that drive meaningful results.
